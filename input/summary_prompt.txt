You must respond ONLY in valid JSON format. No extra text, no explanation.

I have provided two text inputs.

Your tasks are:
1. Identify the main subject/topic of the two texts.
2. Evaluate and choose which text is better (more detailed, clear, or informative).
3. Write a combined summary of both texts without mentioning phrases like "the provided texts" or "Text 1/Text 2" â€” make the summary flow naturally.
4. Translate the summary into Tamil, Telugu, Malayalam and Hindi separately.
5. Create 5 MCQs (Multiple Choice Questions) based on the combined content, where each MCQ should include 4 choices and the correct answer indicated by the choice index.
6. Provide the final output in the following JSON format:

{
  "subject": "String",
  "bestText": "Integer",
  "summary": {
    "english": "String",
    "tamil": "String",
    "telugu": "String",
    "malayalam": "String",
    "hindi": "String"
  },
  "mcqs": [
    {
      "question": "String",
      "choices": ["String", "String", "String", "String"],
      "answer": "Integer"
    }
  ]
}

Text 1: <TEXT1>
Text 2: <TEXT2>
