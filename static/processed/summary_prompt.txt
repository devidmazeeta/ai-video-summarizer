You must respond ONLY in valid JSON format. No extra text, no explanation.

I have provided two text inputs.

Your tasks are:
1. Identify the main subject/topic of the two texts.
2. Evaluate and choose which text is better (more detailed, clear, or informative).
3. Write a combined summary of both texts without mentioning phrases like "the provided texts" or "Text 1/Text 2" â€” make the summary flow naturally.
4. Translate the summary into Tamil, Telugu, Malayalam and Hindi separately.
5. Create 5 MCQs (Multiple Choice Questions) based on the combined content, where each MCQ should include 4 choices and the correct answer indicated by the choice index.
6. Provide the final output in the following JSON format:

{
  "subject": "String",
  "bestText": "Integer",
  "summary": {
    "english": "String",
    "tamil": "String",
    "telugu": "String",
    "malayalam": "String",
    "hindi": "String"
  },
  "mcqs": [
    {
      "question": "String",
      "choices": ["String", "String", "String", "String"],
      "answer": "Integer"
    }
  ]
}

Text 1: hello everyone welcome to the cold war in this video we will understand the concept of inheritance with the real life examples we will also learn about the types of inheritance in Java so let's get started object oriented programming is invented to solve real life problems so all the concept in object oriented programming are inspired by the real life stories inheritance is also a concept that is taken from real life solve Complex problem in programming language so before understanding inheritance in Java we have to understand what is inheritance in real life consider Reliance Industry it is one of the biggest companies in India built by Mukesh Ambani Mukesh Ambani spend millions of dollars and 50 years of his life to build Reliance Industry now it's time for Mukesh Ambani to retire Mukesh Ambani has son who will inherit Reliance Industry from his father means he doesn't have to work from a cash to build the company he can directly reuse his father's work and built his Legacy on it this concept which allows us to inherit our father's money property and efforts is called as inheritance the similar concept we can use in Java inheritance allows us to use the variables methods of one class in another class consider a call addition in which we have written a function that will add two numbers now we want to implement calculator and while implementing the calculator we have to add two numbers so we have already written the code for adding the two numbers in addition class we can use this code using inheritance consider addition as a parent class and calculator as a child class with the help of inheritance we can use the method of addition class which is a parent class into calculator class that is in the child class after inheritance we can use the method of addition class into calculator class without object creation understand the syntax of inheritance first let's define the parent class called addition we will define a method that will take two arguments and return its addition now let's find the child class calculator its Syntax will be like normal class and it will have the methods like a normal class now we have define both the classes so let's inherit the calculator class from the addition class to achieve this we have to use extends keyword and after extreme keywords we have to give the name of a parent class that's all that's all we have to do to implement inheritance now you can access the method of addition class into calculator class now let's take a look at the inheritance in Java there are total five types of inheritance we can implement in Java first type of inheritance is a single inheritance in this type one child class and one parent class is present and child class can access all the methods and variables of a parent class please refer to the description for Syntax second type is multilevel inheritance in this type we can go up to end level of inheritance means child class can also have a child class that is a grand child class and this grand child class can access all the properties of both parents and grandparents class third type is hierarchical inheritance in this type of inheritance planning has two or more child classes and both the child class can access to the properties of a parent class both type is multiple inheritance in this type one child class can have two parent classes and the child class can use the variables and functions of both the parent classes to implement this type of inheritance we have to use a special class call interface we will see the information about this type of inheritance in a separate video the fifth and last type is hybrid inheritance this type is a combination of two or more types of inheritance for example you can see that this inheritance is a combination of hierarchical and multilevel in that's it for today's video if you like this video then please subscribe to my channel thank you
Text 2: what is inheritance in Java inheritance is a fundamental object oriented programming concept in Java that allows a class to inherit properties and behaviour from another class the class that inherited property is known as subclass or Child class and the class from which properties are inherited is known as superclass or parent class the parent child relationship is also known as is a relationship and it is represented by inheritance hits of using inheritance first benefit is code reusability code written in parent class is accessible to all its subclasses second benefit is method overloading it is achieved only through inheritance this is also called runtime polymorphism now we will see example of inheritance animal is a parent class and it has name variable and it method dog is a child class it is extending animal class and it has display method here extend keyword is used for applying in display method we are using name variable which is declared in parent class animal in main method we have created object of dock class we have assigned its name and called method from the parent class as well as child class here is the output of the program if you like this video just eat on the like button you can subscribe to this channel to get interview questions and answer which will help you to crack technical interview watching keep learning
